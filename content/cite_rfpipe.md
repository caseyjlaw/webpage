### rfpipe

I am interested in making usable, open software for radio astronomy. My interests in fast radio transient have required developing entirely new approaches to data analysis that had not been demonstrated with traditional software packages.

[rfpipe](https://github.com/realfastvla/rfpipe) is the next major iteration of that effort. It takes the core functionality of [rtpipe](https://github.com/caseyjlaw/rtpipe) and implements it in a more extensible and maintainable way. I've also put a lot of effort into making it easy to install (using anaconda), python 2/3 compliant, and well tested. Here are the badges to prove it:
